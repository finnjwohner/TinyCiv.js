# TinyCiv.js
TinyCiv.js is an adaptation of a text based python game I used to work on in High School. It builds on it by implementing multiplayer using Node.js's modules express & socket.io.

## Current Project Status
The main foundations are in place, players can join, leave and create games, selecting personal parameters like their name and avatar. The main gameplay loop is also implemented, in that players are able to purchase upgrades which affect what they receive after each year ticks down.

No winning state has been implemented yet and quite a few of the upgrades have no purpose.
